## Hello, I am Ashleylin

I am a student at Imperial College London. I am taking Msc Statistics(Data Science) course. I am not interested in areas such as causal inference, medical statistics and applied machine learning.

Before coming to London, I took a gap year and traveled to several places, including:
- Taiwan
- Seoul
- Barcelona
